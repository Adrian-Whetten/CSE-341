        <p>A little about myself, I really enjoy working outside and hanging 
            out with friends. I really enjoy weight lifting and video games.
            I enjoy playing sports more than watching them. I have an AMAZING
            wife named Jessica, a three year old little girl (Elayna), and 
            two dogs (blue heeler and collie/ausie mix)</p>
