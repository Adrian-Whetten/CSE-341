            Welcome! So glad you came today 
            <?php 
                echo date("d/m/Y");
             ?> 
             of all days!

            A little about myself, I really enjoy working outside and hanging 
            out with friends. <br> I really enjoy weight lifting and video games.
            I enjoy playing sports more than <br> watching them. I have an AMAZING
            wife named Jessica, a three year old little girl <br> (Elayna), and 
            two dogs (blue heeler and collie/ausie mix).
            <br>
            <br>
            As a software engineer, I really enjoy web based development. 
            However, I am <br> fascinated with the backend just as much as 
            I am with the front end. Fullstack is <br> the wasy I want to proceed 
            in my career. To work for BYU-I or somewhere in the <br> Church would
            be a dream come true. The second greatest option in my eyes is <br> 
            to work for INL (Idaho Nuclear Laboratory).
